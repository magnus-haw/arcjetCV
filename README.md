## Installation

### PyPi Installation (Universal)

#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed.

To install **arcjetCV** via **pip** from **PyPi**, run:

```bash
pip install arcjetCV
```

This will install **arcjetCV** along with its dependencies.

#### Note for macOS Users:
You might need to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Note for Linux Users:

You may need to install **libxcb-cursor**. Use your package manager to install it:

For **Ubuntu/Debian**-based distributions:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxcb-cursor0
```

For **Fedora**:
```bash
sudo dnf install libxcb-cursor
```

For **Arch Linux**:
```bash
sudo pacman -S libxcb
```

### Conda Installation

#### Prerequisites:
- A valid **git** installation.
- Installation of **git-lfs** [(Git Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for handling large files.
- **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** for environment and package management:
  - [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/)
  - [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)

For users who prefer **conda** for managing environments, follow these steps:

1. Create a new conda environment and install arcjetCV:

```bash
conda create --name arcjetcv conda-forge::arcjetcv
conda activate arcjetcv
```

This will install **arcjetCV** along with all its dependencies in an isolated environment.

#### Note for macOS Users:
Make sure the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Windows Users and Developers

#### Prerequisites:
- **Git LFS** [(Git Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for handling large files.
- **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** for environment and package management.

For Windows users or for local development of **arcjetCV**, follow these steps:

1. Install `git-lfs`:

   Download and install it from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnus-haw/arcjetCV.git
cd arcjetCV
conda env create -f env/arcjetCV_env_[cpu/gpu].yml
conda activate arcjetcv
python -m pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag stands for 'editable' and means that any changes to the local source code will immediately affect the **arcjetCV** package and GUI.


## How to Run

You can now launch the GUI by running:

```bash
conda activate arcjetcv # (if using conda)
arcjetCV
```

Alternatively, you can use **arcjetCV's Python API** inside a Python script, e.g., `test.py`:

```python
import arcjetCV as arcv
video = arcv.Video("tests/arcjet_test.mp4")
```

Run the script with:

```bash
conda activate arcjetcv # (if using conda)
python test.py
```
