## Installation

### Prerequisites
The installation of the arcjetCV GUI and python package require a valid git installation, installation of the git-lfs [(git large file storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) add-on and a 
[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) or
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) installation. 

### Unix Users

The software can be installed by running:

```bash
conda create --name arcjetcv conda-forge::arcjetcv
```
#### Note for macOS Users:


Please ensure that you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Windows Users and Developers

For local development of arcjetCV and for Windows users, these are the recommended installation steps:

1. **Install `git lfs` (Git Large File Storage):**

   You can download and install it from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. **Clone the repository and install the package:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnus-haw/arcjetCV.git
cd arcjetCV
conda env create -f env/arcjetCV_env_[cpu/gpu].yml
conda activate arcjetCV
python -m pip install -e . 
```

The -e flag stands for 'editable' and it means that any change to the local source code will have immediate effect on the arcjetCV python package and GUI.

## How to Run

You can now launch the GUI by running:

```bash
conda activate arcjetCV
arcjetCV
```

or you can import arcjetCV's python API inside a python script, e.g. test.py:

```python
import arcjetCV as arcv
video = arcv.Video("tests/arcjet_test.mp4")
```

and then run it as:

```bash
conda activate arcjetCV
python test.py
```
